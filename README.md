  <h1>WP ViteJS 4 starter kit</h1>
  <p>
Vite simple lightweight starter kit for WordPress plugin and theme development to make use of Vite's blazing fast and efficient frontend build tool. The "src" folder includes JS, PostCSS, images, fonts, SVG and a gutenberg block as examples.

You can read more about ViteJS on [vitejs.dev](https://vitejs.dev)

## Usages

Install the packages and build our assets into the 'build' folder.
```
yarn install
yarn build
```

This will build the assets in dev mode. You can use the 'isDev' variable inside the ViteJS config to use different configurations.
```
yarn build-dev
```

Builds assets in real-time and watches over files.
```
yarn watch
yarn watch-dev
```

Starts ViteJS dev server.
```
yarn start
```

## ViteJS Config
The config is configured to use esbuild for minification and turns off minification + includes a sourcemap when using the `-dev` commands. It also includes the following:

- Esbuild configuration to make ReactJS code work inside `.js` files instead of `.jsx`
- Custom ViteJS plugin that updates/refreshes the dev server (HMR) when a change is made inside PHP files
- Custom RollupJS plugin that encapsulates our JS bundles to prevent mix-up of global variables after minification
- Custom RollupJS plugin that collects images, SVG and font files and emits them to make them transformable by plugins
- [Vite Plugin Image Optimizer](https://github.com/FatehAK/vite-plugin-image-optimizer) that optimizes images and SVG files that we emit

## PostCSS config

PostCC is added through the ViteJS config file and is currently configured with the following:
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to add a utility-first CSS framework that scans all of our files, and only generate styles and classes that we use.
- [TailwindCSS nesting](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#nesting) to unwrap nested rules similar to SASS.
- [PostCSS import](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-import) that can consume local files, node modules or web_modules using the `@import` rule.
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules using values from Can I Use.
- [PostCSS combine duplicated selectors](https://github.com/ChristianMurphy/postcss-combine-duplicated-selectors) that detects and combines duplicated CSS selectors.

## TailwindCSS config
TailwindCSS is added through the PostCSS config file and currently the following are only configured:
- Paths to find TailwindCSS classes for optimization. This will make sure it only generates styles that are needed.
- A prefix that will be added to all of Tailwindâ€™s generated utility classes. This can be really useful to prevent naming conflicts with other themes and plugins.

[Read here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) more about all the cool stuff you can configure with Tailwind.

## Other configurations
The idea here is to keep the starter kit simple so additional things can be added for different projects, and so it can be integrated into different theme and plugin structures.
- With the "rollUpCopyAssets" test rules you're able to add additional asset folders with other test rules aside to images/svg/fonts
